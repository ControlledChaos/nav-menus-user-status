# Nav Menus User Status

Enhancement for ClassicPress & WordPress navigation menus.

Show navigation menu items based on user login status. User role filtering may come.

This is a fork of the [User Menus â€“ Nav Menu Visibility](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-menus/) plugin which is great in functionality but awful in admin nags. This plugin removes the junk from the other menu.

:warning: **Activation warning:** This plugin has not yet made concession for the original plugin being active. Deactivate the User Menus plugin prior to activating this plugin.
